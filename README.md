### Vanilla `JavaScript` application for switching colors

- The main idea behind this project is to work with `SCSS` and manipulate the DOM directly though JS code not using any Framework in particular.

- The application works with `localStorage` to set the different colors.
- There are two 'modes' in which the application works:
    - Using a predefined list of HEX codes for the different colors that are going to be displayed.  
    This is done for purely for aesthetic purposes.
    - Generating random HEX codes for different colors.
- Users can switch between the two modes. Modes are also perserved in the `localStorage`.

- To 'start' the application just load the `index.html` file in a browser of your choice.
